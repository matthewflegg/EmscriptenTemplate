 ## Prerequisites 
 * Python 3
 * Linux
 
 ## Tips
 * In `Makefile`, remove `all: main server` to stop hosting a test server automatically. If you do this, you must run `make main` and `make server` separately.
 * All files generated by Emscripten will be placed in `bin/`. This will be the root directory of the test server. Change this by modifying the value of `BIN` in `Makefile`.
